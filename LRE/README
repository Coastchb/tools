INTRODUCTION
============

This package is used to support the AP16-OLE challenge.

Here we provide two scripts for calculating Cavg*100 and IDR, respectively.

Besides, with the help of DETware which you can download from the NIST homepage, 
EER, minDCF and DET curves are also obtained.

DESCRIPTION
============

1. Prepare the score file (refers to 'demo.score')

The score file should be in the following format:
		
	          ct-cn   id-id   ja-jf   ko-kr   ru-ru   vi-vn   zh-cn
	utt-id-1  score-1 score-2 score-3 score-4 score-5 score-6 score-7
	utt-id-2  score-1 score-2 score-3 score-4 score-5 score-6 score-7
        ...

utt-id-x: the identity of test utterance
score-x : the score of the test utterance belonging to language x

Refer to the following paper for more details about the evaluation plan:

Dong Wang, Lantian Li, Difei Tang, and Qing Chen, "AP16-OL7: A Multilingual 
Database for Oriental Languages and A Language Recognition Baseline", APSIPA 2016.


2. Cavg

Compute_Cavg.py: read a score file and the key file (label.scp) to 
compute Cavg and the minimum Cavg. Python 2.x is required.

Example: Compute_Cavg.py demo.score label.scp


3. IDR

Compute_IDR.py: read a score file and the key file (label.scp) to 
compute identification rate (IDR). Python 2.x is required.

Example: Compute_IDR.py demo.score label.scp


4. EER, minDCF and DET curves

(1). Prepare_Det.py: read a score file and the key file (label.scp) to 
generate true_speaker_scores(default by target.txt) and impostor_scores(default by nontarget.txt). 
Python 2.x is required.

(2). run Eval_Spkr_Det.m in ./DET to obtain EER, minDCF and DET curves.

Example: Prepare_Det.py demo.score label.scp
         cd DET
         matlab Eval_Spkr_Det.m
